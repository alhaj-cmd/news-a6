        <h3>1. What are the differences among var, let and const?</h3>
            <p> Variables declared with var are in the function scope. Variables declared as let are in the block scope.
                Variables declared as const are in the block scope.
             To reassign a value is to reassign the value of a variable. In var and let reassign is allowed but in
            const it is not allowed.
             Hoisting means that you can define a variable before its declaration. In var hoisting is allowed but in
            let and const it is not allowed.
        </p>
        <h3>2. What are the differences between arrow and regular function?</h3>
        <p> • We can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow functions.
            Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.
            • Arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments. The arrow function, on the
            opposite, doesn't define arguments i.e. they do not have arguments binding.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Why do we use template strings?</h3>
        <p> Because string interpolation makes things so much simpler.
            • only one pair of quotes (back-ticks)
            • embedded (interpolated) variables and expressions
            • multiple lines within the quotes (pre-formatted text)
            • treated like strings so can be assigned or be a return value
